Na playful la thane unna love pannen so "I thought forgetting U would be easy..."

Athukku aprm kooda unna approach panna nu thonuchi but i Stopped myself...


          
But I was struggling...


Full day unna pathi mattu tha think pannitu irunthen...

Na romba ve confused ah iruthen <strong>"How can i love a person this much in a short period of time??? "</strong> Appadi I was questioning myself... 

My thought always drifted towards you...

Still romba try panna to stop thinking about u...

But appo la weird ana coincidence la nadakkum...



Most of the time unna break la pakka try panuven...So un class or corridor la wait pannuven but always...I need to search for u mari tha irukkum...

But the thing that would crush me during those days vanthu Realization...

End of every single day<strong> "Yen mind fulla ve unnoda thought tha irundhuchu, aana atleast oru vaati achi avalukku ennoda thought ava mind-la vandhuchaa?" </strong>

Appadi oru question pathi think pannuven...

And Every single day  i know the answer to that question will be "No "... 



Na expect panna ve illa getting Ignored by u can be this painful nu...

Because there is nothing between us...We were not even friends la appadi irukku pothu why did it hurt me...

<strong>It felt wrong to give up the love i had for u...</strong>

It was hurtful for me to persist this feeling...

But i would have suffered more If I have decided to give up...

So unkitta almost ellathaium solliten...


Ni enkitta keta la "Unakku yen mela feelings irukku appo how can u see me as a friend nu??"

Ni ketathu correct tha Na unna friend pakkurathu rombe ve kastam tha...

But yen intension enna therium ma "I wanted to be friend and tell u all this things and wanted to hear ur response" 

This was all i wanted with u...I never expected u to change ur mind...

All i expected was u to listen to me and give me some time...Bcoz i cant say all this things to u in single conversation...


Ni en Kitta "yen Special Nu" keta and I answered u...Was i wrong to ask u how did u feel about it?...I dont think so...

Ni en kitta athu romba oru simple ana question mari keta...But i didnt feel same way about that question...

It felt so important for me to answer that question...Na Night fulla thoongama i was thinking for a answer...

I just wanted a response from u...Good or bad...I just wanted to know how u feel about it...

Ippo sollu na unkitta antha pathi keta thu thappa was i trying anything with u??


Na first time unna approach pannu pothu tha, u gave me clear rejection...U never gave me any false hope...

All i wanted from the friendship is a chances to tell u how important u were to me and get to know u better...


Ennakku onnu mattu puriyala "Why did my love bother u so much bcoz u were constantly saying me to change??"

I know my love towards u may spoil me but, i didnt let it la!! yen itha oru thing mela ivalo concern aa iruntha??

Ni en kitta neriya vatti "I dont value u mari rude aa pesi irukka..."

Kandippa ni enna value panna mata becoz u dont know anyhing about me appadi iruku pothum "How would u value me??"

and also I know u as person...I kinda know ur intention mari iruthuchi...

U wanted to trigger my ego and wanted me to hate u...

But i wont do that for that useless ego thing...

Ennakku theriyala ni atha serious aa sonniya or u were trying to convince me...

Regardless it was hurtful for me too hear those things...


So na unkitta Ellame solliten la ippo think pannu "Did i deserve that?? Did i deserve to be treated like that??"

I was expecting the basic things from u but ni enna anthu mari treat pannathu correct aa??

U never gave me any chance to explain my intention...U never gave me any chance to tell u how i feel...


Unakku yen mela love varala na athukaga na worry panna maten...I would just feel really unlucky about that...

Bcoz I know how love feels... u never get an option to choose ...It just happens...

We both dont have any conrol over it...All i can do about that is just to hope it might happen...

If u dont have control over it mari irutha mattu tha that is true love...Which i to much to ask for anyone...So i never demanded that from u...

Athu nala tha i asked to be friends...So atleast i get to know u better...
